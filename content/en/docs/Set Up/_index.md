  Installation, pre-requisites, and system requirements
---

Statiko runs on Linux servers, as a Docker container (recommended) or as a standalone app. You can also run Statiko on a Kubernetes cluster, along with your back-end services.

You can install Statiko on **any cloud or on-premises**, and it runs on nodes of any size: from large datacenter-grade servers, to small **Raspberry Pi**'s.
